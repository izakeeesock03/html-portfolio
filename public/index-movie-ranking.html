<h1>The Best Movies According to Izak</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Thor Ragnorok</h3>
<p>I love the blend of comedic Thor and serious Thor.
   I also have always loved the Thor movies. From Asgard,
   to the imagery, the setting, to Thor the superhero himself. He's got 
   cool powers.</p>

<h3>Corpse Bride</h3>
<p>Beautiful movie. Amazing songs. Simple plot, but rewatchable and 
   sets the tone for the fall season.

<h3>Detatchment</h3>
<p>Tear-jerking movie. Beautifully made, dealing with a serious issue that touches 
   all of our hearts. My favorite serious-topic movie.</p>
